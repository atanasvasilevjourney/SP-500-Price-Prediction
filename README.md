S&P 500 Price Prediction using ARIMA

This project focuses on forecasting the **S&P 500 Index closing prices** using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, time series analysis, model building, and forecasting, and evaluates the model's performance with visual and statistical metrics.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Converts raw S&P 500 daily data to business-day frequency
- Visualizes moving average and standard deviation
- Performs **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** to check stationarity
- Builds and trains an **ARIMA(2,1,1)** model
- Forecasts:
  - Close price for a specific day (e.g., **Monday, May 19, 2025**)
  - Price trends for the **next month**, **next 3 months**, and **until the end of 2025**
- Plots actual vs predicted values for easy comparison
- Evaluates model accuracy with **RMSE** and **MAE**
